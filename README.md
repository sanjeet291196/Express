###### Express yourself in common languages

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The app provides users to view some common terminologies in three different languages viz. English, Hindi and a local Indian language(Telugu). This is to let the person convey or express himself to someone who do not understand english and hindi and also enables local users to know common translation to english and hindi.

The app idea was taken from Udacity's Miwok app.
